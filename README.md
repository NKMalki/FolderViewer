# FolderViewer
A SWE316: Software Design and Construction homework.
## Initilization
This project only works on Visual Studio for some reason.
## Project Requirements:
File/Folder combination is a typical example of the composite design pattern. A file has a name, size, extension. A
folder has similar attribute (without an extension) plus a list of files or other folders. You are required to write a
demonstration application that traverses files and folders in a selected directory. 
## Visual Samples of The Application:
